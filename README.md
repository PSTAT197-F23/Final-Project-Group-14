# Outlier and Anomaly Detection

Vignette on implementing outlier and anomaly detection using breast cancer detection data; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2023.

**Contributors:** Kyle Wu, Jimmy Dysart

## Executive Summary

As the names suggest, outlier and anomaly detection are methods meant to identify data points that appear to fall outside the normal range. These anomalous observations are often rare and present patterns not present for standard data points. Much like in regular machine learning models, anomaly detection methods fall into 3 main categories; supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised models.

## Repository Content

This repository includes a vignette demonstrating the implementation of a number of anomaly/outlier detection methods. The repository also includes the data used, as well as scripts containing the end-to-end implementation of the models utilized. 


## Methods of interest

In this vignette, we will demonstrate the efficacy of a number of different models and their consequent ability to identify outliers that may be present in the data. In particular, our models of interest are:

> 1.  Isolation Forests
> 2.  Local Outlier Factors
> 3.  One class SVM

## Dataset
Our dataset was downloaded from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
