# Outlier and Anomaly Detection


## Executive Summary

As the names suggest, outlier and anomaly detection are methods meant to identify data points that appear to fall outside the normal range. These anomalous observations are often rare and present patterns not present for standard data points. Much like in regular machine learning models, anomaly detection methods fall into 3 main categories; supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised models.

## Methods of interest

In this vignette, we will demonstrate the efficacy of a number of different models and their consequent ability to identify outliers that may be present in the data.

> 1.  Isolation Forests
> 2.  Local Outlier Factors
> 3.  One class SVM
