## Executive summary

As the names suggest, outlier and anomaly detection are methods meant to identify data points that appear to fall outside the normal range. These anomalous observations are often rare and present patterns not present for standard data points. Much like in regular machine learning models, anomaly detection methods fall into 3 main categories; supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised models.

## Methods of interest

In this vignette, we will demonstrate the efficacy of a number of different models and their consequent ability to identify outliers that may be present in the data.

> 1.  Isolation Forests
> 2.  Local Outlier Factors
> 3.  One class SVM


## Data description

The data set in this vignette has been drawn from the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database and includes a list of 30 features from 569 patients computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of the nuclei present in the image. 

Observations in the data set are classified into 2 categories, benign or malignant. In this data set, 357 of the patients received a benign diagnosis, while 212 received a malignant diagnosis.

## Procedure

**Lightly describe how we cleaned the data and made sure it was ready to be used for our methods below**


### Isolation Forests

### Local Outlier

### One Class SVM
